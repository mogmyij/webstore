# Karvana E-Commerce Architecture Requirements Document

This document outlines the architectural design decisions for the Karvana E-Commerce platform, focusing on technical implementation details to guide development team members. The architecture is designed to support a clean, modern, and trustworthy online platform specializing in mobility products such as motorized wheelchairs and mobility scooters.

## System Overview

Karvana's e-commerce platform is built using a modern web stack with React and Next.js, focusing initially on desktop viewing experiences with future mobile responsiveness in mind. The system enables users to browse products, filter and search, view detailed product information, add items to cart, and complete purchases through a guest checkout flow integrated with HitPay payment processing.

### High-Level Architecture

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain
skinparam componentStyle rectangle
skinparam backgroundColor transparent

package "Frontend" {
  [Next.js App] as NextApp
  [React Components] as Components
  [Context API] as Context
  [Tailwind CSS] as Tailwind
}

package "Backend" {
  [Next.js API Routes] as APIRoutes
  [Database] as DB

## Frontend Architecture

### Component Structure

The frontend architecture follows a component-based design pattern with a clear separation of concerns:

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain
skinparam backgroundColor transparent

package "Pages" {
  [Home Page]
  [Shop Page]
  [Product Detail Page]
  [Shopping Cart Page]
  [Checkout Page]
  [Order Confirmation Page]
}

package "Components" {
  package "Common" {
    [Header]
    [Footer]
    [Banner]
    [AccordionItem]
  }
  
  package "Shop" {
    [ProductCard]
    [FilterSidebar]
    [SortDropdown]
    [QuantitySelector]
  }
  
  package "Homepage" {
    [Bestsellers]
    [Benefits]
    [Values]
  }
}

package "Context" {
  [CartContext]
}

package "Data" {
  [Products]
  [Constants]
}

[Home Page] --> [Banner]
[Home Page] --> [Bestsellers]
[Home Page] --> [Benefits]
[Home Page] --> [Values]

[Shop Page] --> [FilterSidebar]
[Shop Page] --> [SortDropdown]
[Shop Page] --> [ProductCard]

[Product Detail Page] --> [AccordionItem]
[Product Detail Page] --> [QuantitySelector]

[Shopping Cart Page] --> [QuantitySelector]

[CartContext] --> [Products]

@enduml
```

### State Management

The application uses React Context API for global state management, particularly for the shopping cart functionality:

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain
skinparam backgroundColor transparent

package "CartContext" {
  class "CartProvider" as Provider {
    + cartItems: CartItem[]
    + addToCart(product: Product, quantity: number): void
    + removeFromCart(productId: number): void
    + updateQuantity(productId: number, quantity: number): void
    + clearCart(): void
    + getCartTotal(): number
    + getItemCount(): number
  }
  
  class "CartItem" as Item {
    + id: number
    + name: string
    + price: number
    + image: string
    + quantity: number
    + ...other product properties
  }
  
  class "useCart Hook" as Hook {
    + Returns CartContext
  }
}

Provider --> Item : manages
Hook --> Provider : accesses

@enduml
```

The cart state persists across sessions using browser localStorage, allowing users to maintain their cart items even if they close and reopen the browser.

## Backend Architecture

### API Routes

Next.js API routes serve as the backend for the application, handling server-side logic:

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain
skinparam backgroundColor transparent

package "Next.js API Routes" {
  [Create Payment Request]
  [Webhook Handler]
  [Order Management]
}

database "Database" {
  [Orders]
  [Products]
  [Transactions]
}

[Create Payment Request] --> [HitPay API] : sends payment request
[HitPay API] --> [Webhook Handler] : sends payment status
[Webhook Handler] --> [Orders] : updates order status
[Order Management] --> [Orders] : creates/reads orders
[Order Management] --> [Products] : reads product data
[Order Management] --> [Transactions] : records transaction details

@enduml
```

### Database Schema

While the current implementation uses mock data, the planned database schema will support the application's requirements:

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain
skinparam backgroundColor transparent

entity "Products" {
  * id : number >
  --
  * name : string
  * price : number
  * image : string
  images : string[]
  * brand : string
  * category : string
  * description : string
  * longDescription : string
  * specifications : json
  * features : string[]
  * dateAdded : date
}

entity "Orders" {
  * id : string >
  --
  * customerName : string
  * customerEmail : string
  * customerPhone : string
  * shippingAddress : string
  * orderTotal : number
  * orderStatus : string
  * createdAt : datetime
  * updatedAt : datetime
  * hitpayPaymentId : string >
}

entity "OrderItems" {
  * id : number >
  --
  * orderId : string >
  * productId : number >
  * quantity : number
  * price : number
}

entity "HitPayTransactions" {
  * id : string >
  --
  * paymentRequestId : string
  * paymentId : string
  * amount : number
  * currency : string
  * status : string
  * createdAt : datetime
  * updatedAt : datetime
}

Orders ||--o{ OrderItems
OrderItems }|--|| Products
Orders ||--|| HitPayTransactions

@enduml
```

## Payment Integration Architecture

The HitPay payment integration follows this flow:

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain
skinparam backgroundColor transparent

actor User
participant "Frontend" as FE
participant "Next.js API" as API
participant "HitPay API" as HP
participant "Database" as DB

User -> FE : Completes checkout form
FE -> API : POST /api/create-payment
API -> DB : Create pending order
API -> HP : Create payment request
HP --> API : Return payment URL/ID
API --> FE : Return payment details
FE -> User : Redirect to payment page
User -> HP : Complete payment
HP -> API : POST /api/webhook (payment status)
API -> DB : Update order status
API -> FE : Redirect to confirmation page
FE -> User : Display order confirmation

@enduml
```

## Data Flow Architecture

The overall data flow in the application follows this pattern:

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain
skinparam backgroundColor transparent

actor User
boundary "UI Components" as UI
control "Context API" as Context
control "Next.js API Routes" as API
entity "Database" as DB
boundary "HitPay" as HP

User -> UI : Interacts with UI
UI -> Context : Updates application state
Context -> UI : Renders updated state

UI -> API : Makes API requests
API -> DB : Queries/updates data
DB --> API : Returns data
API --> UI : Returns response

UI -> HP : Initiates payment
HP --> API : Sends webhook
API -> DB : Updates order status
DB --> UI : Updated order data
UI --> User : Shows confirmation

@enduml
```

## Responsive Design Strategy

While the initial focus is on desktop viewing, the architecture supports future mobile responsiveness:

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain
skinparam backgroundColor transparent

package "Responsive Design Strategy" {
  [Tailwind CSS Breakpoints]
  [Mobile-First Components]
  [Responsive Images]
  [Adaptive Layouts]
}

[Tailwind CSS Breakpoints] --> [Mobile-First Components] : defines
[Mobile-First Components] --> [Responsive Images] : incorporates
[Mobile-First Components] --> [Adaptive Layouts] : implements

note bottom of [Tailwind CSS Breakpoints]
  sm: 640px
  md: 768px
  lg: 1024px
  xl: 1280px
  2xl: 1536px
end note

@enduml
```

## Deployment Architecture

The application is designed to be deployed on modern serverless platforms:

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain
skinparam backgroundColor transparent

cloud "Vercel/Netlify" {
  [Static Assets] as Static
  [Next.js App] as App
  [Serverless Functions] as Functions
}

database "Database Service" as DB
cloud "HitPay" as HP

[App] --> [Static] : serves
[App] --> [Functions] : calls
[Functions] --> [DB] : queries/updates
[Functions] --> [HP] : integrates with

@enduml
```

## Security Considerations

The architecture incorporates several security measures:

1. **Payment Security**: HitPay handles payment processing, reducing PCI DSS compliance requirements
2. **Data Protection**: Sensitive customer data is only stored when necessary
3. **API Security**: Next.js API routes validate requests and implement CORS policies
4. **Webhook Validation**: HitPay webhooks are validated using HMAC signatures

## Performance Optimization

Performance optimizations include:

1. **Server-Side Rendering**: Next.js provides SSR for improved initial page load
2. **Image Optimization**: Next.js Image component for automatic optimization
3. **Code Splitting**: Automatic code splitting for smaller bundle sizes
4. **Client-Side Navigation**: Fast page transitions without full page reloads
5. **Caching Strategy**: Leveraging browser caching and Next.js caching mechanisms

## Development Workflow

```plantuml
